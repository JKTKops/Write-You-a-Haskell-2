Like any complicated project, ProtoHaskell is built on the shoulders of giants. Here I'll keep a running list of papers and websites that I've read while working on this project. I'll try to cite them out of here when one is referenced from a chapter. Please feel free to add missing citations!

In no particular order:

[4] [GHC Source Tree](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/tree/master). Many ideas and some implementations are taken and adapted from GHC sources. Header comments on such modules will indicate when this is the case.
